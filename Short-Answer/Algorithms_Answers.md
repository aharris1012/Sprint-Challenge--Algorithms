## Exercise II

(First of all an egg is going to brake even if you drop it from 5ft off the ground but okaayyyy HAHA! )

To be able to find out what floor "f" is and see which one is less than "f" for the eggs to be broken. We need to go to the first floor and drop and egg. If the egg breaks than the 1st floor is "f". If it does not break continue to the next floor until the egg breaks.
